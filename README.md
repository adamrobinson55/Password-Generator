# Password Generator

## What it does

This website generates passwords using Javascript. It uses a base of HTML to layout a structure and CSS to style the structure. The Javascript first checks when the "Generate Password" button is pressed, when pressed it will execute the Generate password function, first it will clear the password, then through a series of alerts it will generate a variable num for password length and booleans for what the password should contain. The code generates first an array that contains one each character type, it will concatenate this to the rest of the password that generated throught the use of random numbers and arrays containing symbols and letters.

At first I found myself creating too much code for this project, I was rewriting the random number generator multiple times, and before concatenating two arrays I had made a long series of if statements and for loops that would check and return booleans if the password contained all the required character types. I couldn't get that working and used the two arrays as a simpler solution. If I were to redo this project, I'd like to get the password checking system to work.
